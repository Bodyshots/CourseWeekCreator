# Create Multiple Week Folders For Your Courses Instantly!
## About
A short little program that I personally use to quickly get myself set up for a semester. Originally being a simple Python program, I rewrote the entire project in Java in a more "code design friendly" way.

Basically, the program creates x number of "Week" folders, given an inputted file path, year, and course code.

## How to Use
Run FolderCreator.java and enter the program's required inputs.

## To Do
- Documentation
- General refactoring
- .exe file
