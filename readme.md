# Create Multiple Folders Instantly!
## About
A short little program that I personally use to quickly get myself set up for a semester. Originally being a simple Python program, I rewrote the entire project in Java in a more "code design friendly" way.

Basically, it creates a specified # of folders at a specified destination.

## How to Use
Run FolderCreator.java and enter the program's required inputs.

## To Do
- .exe file
- Possible conversion w/ JavaFX?
